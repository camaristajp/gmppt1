WHAT REVISION 2 GOT WRONG -- defect D17

    Revision 2 built every profile with a FIXED steps_per_block. The slope was
    stored in the dataclass and never used to determine how many control steps
    the ramp occupied, so every slope in a sequence produced the identical block
    sequence and the identical result:

        30-100 @ 10 W/m2/s   ->  69.634%
        30-100 @ 100 W/m2/s  ->  69.634%

    Byte for byte, across all six slopes. A tenfold change in ramp speed changed
    nothing, which is impossible for a real dynamic test. The p10 comparison run
    on that profile therefore re-measured the STATIC result under a different
    name: P&O's 69.6% on shaded scenarios against 99.96% on uniform is
    local-peak trapping, already measured in P2.7 as a 42.1% arrival rate. No
    dynamic conclusion could be drawn from it.

    Slope only becomes meaningful once control steps are tied to TIME:

        steps in a ramp = t1 / T_control = dG / (slope * T_control)

    At a 100 ms control period, slope 10 gives 70 s -> 700 steps while slope 100
    gives 7 s -> 70 steps. A tracker that keeps up with the first may not keep up
    with the second, and that difference is the entire point of the dynamic test.

    Revision 3 derives per-block step counts from the standard's phase times and
    a declared control period. test_slope_changes_step_count is added as the
    check that would have caught D17, written so it CAN fail.

WHAT CHANGED IN REVISION 2 (retained)

    Revision 1 reconstructed the ramp profile from figure captions and
    arithmetic consistency. Alonso & Chenlo reproduce EN 50530's Annex B
    sequences in full as their Tables IV, V and VI. Three parameters were wrong:
    Sequence A has ELEVEN slopes not six; cycle counts VARY from 2 to 10 with
    slope; t0 = 300 s was absent; and the third sequence (1% => 10%) was missing
    entirely -- the case every measured inverter scored worst on.

    Two ambiguities were resolved. The standard's Figure 6 labels its y-axis
    "equivalent normalised irradiance G/G_STC", so ramps are linear in
    IRRADIANCE and the "% P_DCn" in the Annex B titles is a naming convention.
    And every tabulated ramp time satisfies t1 = t3 = dG / slope, which is how
    the tables were cross-checked.

    A later correction: t0 = 300 s applies per SLOPE ROW, not once per sequence.
    Confirmed from the published per-row durations -- Sequence B row 1 is
    10*(70+10+70+10) = 1600 s against a printed 1900 s.

SOURCES

    EN 50530:2010, consulted as SIST EN 50530:2011 (stated identical). Available
    portion: front matter through clause 4.3.2. Annexes B and C NOT available.

    M. Alonso and F. Chenlo, "Testing microinverters according to EN 50530",
    CIEMAT, Madrid. Reproduces Annex B as Tables IV, V and VI, and publishes
    measured dynamic efficiencies for three commercial inverters.

    EVERY TIMING BELOW COMES FROM ALONSO & CHENLO, not from the standard
    directly. That provenance travels with any figure produced here.

VERIFIED IN THE STANDARD ITSELF -- clause 3.4.1, equation (5)

        eta_dyn = [ sum_i U_DC,i * I_DC,i * dT_i ]
                  / [ sum_j P_MPP,PVS,j * dT_j ]

    Two consequences, both load-bearing:

      IT IS AN ENERGY RATIO, not a mean of instantaneous efficiencies. The two
      differ whenever available power varies, and the mean-of-ratios form would
      overweight the dim portions of a ramp where absolute errors are small.

      THE DENOMINATOR IS BLOCK-WISE. The sum over j runs across intervals of
      constant available power. Block discretisation is therefore the standard's
      OWN structure, not an approximation introduced here to save compute.

    Aggregation across slopes is an UNWEIGHTED mean (a_i = 1). Verified
    arithmetically: Alonso & Chenlo's eleven Sequence-A values average to
    99.116%, matching their printed total of 99.12%.

DECLARED DIVERGENCES -- five, all deliberate, all stated with any figure

  1. EQUIPMENT CLASS. Clause 1 scopes the standard to grid-connected inverters
     energising a low-voltage grid. This project measures a module-level DC
     optimizer: no AC side, no grid, no conversion efficiency. Only the
     MPPT-efficiency half is borrowed.

  2. SINGLE VERSUS MULTIPLE MPP. The standard assumes one MPP. Alonso & Chenlo
     state plainly that operation with shadowed I-V curves having more than one
     local MPP is not considered in EN 50530 and could be included for future
     developments. This project is entirely about that case, so the extension
     fills a gap the standard's own testers identified -- but it must be NAMED.

  3. HOW SHADING MEETS THE RAMP. The standard ramps irradiance uniformly. Here a
     FIXED shading pattern is held and every substring is scaled by the same
     factor, so the ratio between substrings -- which creates the peaks -- is
     preserved while the level follows the standard's ramp.

     MEASURED CONSEQUENCE: the GMPP voltage moves only about 2% of V_oc across a
     full 300-1000 W/m2 excursion, because current scales with irradiance while
     the peak voltage shifts only logarithmically. This profile moves the
     available POWER a great deal and the peak LOCATION barely at all. It is
     therefore a test of dynamic power tracking, NOT of dynamic global-peak
     relocation. Shading-PATTERN transitions, where the peak jumps between
     substrings, are the experiment that stresses the latter, and EN 50530
     cannot produce one by construction.

  4. PV GENERATOR MODEL. Annex C is normative and specifies a 1-diode model with
     technology-dependent parameters. It was not available. This project uses
     pvlib's single-diode model with CEC parameters, validated in Phase 1 to
     about 1% against 616 measured curves. Swapping simulators for the dynamic
     profile alone would make dynamic figures incomparable with every static
     result in the project, which is a worse problem than the model mismatch.

  5. CONTROL PERIOD AND TIME COMPRESSION. The partner's control period is
     unknown and is DECLARED at 100 ms below. A uniform time compression is
     applied per sequence so profiles fit a simulation budget; it is applied
     EQUALLY to every slope in a sequence, so the ratio between slopes -- which
     is what the test measures -- is preserved exactly.

THE VALIDATION TARGET -- the reason this harness can be trusted

    Alonso & Chenlo measured three commercial inverters under these sequences:

        Inverter PH (micro)   99.12%  99.21%  96.55%
        Inverter SM (string)  93.48%  98.07%  94.02%
        Inverter CY (micro)   85.91%  85.13%  86.33%
                              10-50%  30-100%  1-10%

    Running P&O on UNIFORM scenarios -- single peak, the case the standard was
    written for -- should land in roughly the same band. DECLARED: outside
    85-100%, the instrument is suspect and no shaded figure should be trusted.

    CAVEAT: those are inverters with their own converters and sampling rates.
    Agreement to a BAND is meaningful; agreement to a decimal place would be
    coincidence. Scoring ABOVE them is expected, because this simulation is
    noiseless and quasi-static -- it measures the algorithm without the converter
    losses real hardware carries.
