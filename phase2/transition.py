transitions.py  --  P2.9: shading-PATTERN-transition sequences (dynamic peak
                    relocation), driven by real sun geometry.

PLACE THIS FILE AT:   C:\\Users\\user\\gmppt\\phase2\\transitions.py
                      NEW FILE. gmppt/ is not modified.

SELF-TEST:
    python phase2\\transitions.py

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHY IT EXISTS
    EN 50530 (gmppt/dynamic.py) cannot move the global peak between substrings:
    it holds ONE shading pattern and scales every substring by the same factor,
    so the peak voltage shifts only ~2% of V_oc. This module produces the case
    it cannot -- the shading PATTERN changing over time so the darkest substring
    shifts and the GMPP RELOCATES from one substring region to another. That
    relocation is the event the tracker comparison (p12) measures.

    The sequences it emits are the dataset for BOTH the journal's dynamic-
    relocation result AND the dashboard playback. Generated once, to journal
    standard, so the dashboard gets it for free.

TIME-OF-DAY IS PHYSICAL, NOT COSMETIC
    The shadow sweeps because the SUN MOVES. Sun azimuth/elevation over the day
    come from pvlib.solarposition for a DECLARED site and date; the shadow band's
    position on the module is driven by that azimuth. So a relocation "at 13:50"
    is a consequence of solar geometry, not an arbitrary label -- and the sweep
    rate is non-uniform through the day exactly as the real sun's is.

DECLARED SYNTHETIC PARAMETERS -- labelled, cited, and UPGRADEABLE
    Nanum's array geometry is not yet in hand, so the site and shading object are
    DECLARED SYNTHETIC. They are not invented conveniences:
      * SITE = Jeju, KR (33.45 N, 126.57 E) -- the collaboration's actual
        location. Real place; only the array geometry on it is synthetic.
      * REFERENCE_DATE = an equinox -- the representative mid-range sun path
        (a solstice would be an edge case, not a default).
      * MODULE tilt/azimuth = fixed-tilt, tilt ~= latitude, due south -- the
        textbook default for the site, pending Nanum's real mounting.
      * SHADOW BAND width / depth and its azimuth window = a representative
        structural/pole shadow, declared with physical ranges.
    Every one of these is a module constant below; replace with Nanum's measured
    values when they arrive and the sequences upgrade with no code change. Any
    figure derived here TRAVELS WITH the label "declared synthetic site (Jeju
    reference), pending partner geometry."

VALIDATION IS THE SPINE (the standing rule: validate before any figure is read)
    A relocation dataset is the easiest to accidentally rig, so every generated
    sequence must pass the gates below before it may enter the tracker
    comparison. A sequence that fails a gate is DISCARDED and counted, never
    reported. Gates, not diagnostics.

      G1  RELOCATION ACTUALLY OCCURS.  The TRUE GMPP substring (from the
          simulator's analyse(), not from the shading proxy) must change at least
          once and cross a boundary. Prevents a "relocation test" that never
          relocates -- silently becoming the EN 50530 non-case. If G1 fails, the
          shading is too shallow to make a bypass diode conduct; deepen
          SHADE_DEPTH. This is the gate that makes the goal real.
      G2  CURVE INTEGRITY.  Every step's curve must reproduce its own GMPP under
          interpolation to 1e-3 (mirrors dynamic.py's p_check). Prevents
          orientation/label bugs (D9-class) contaminating a curve. Enforced
          inside the builder -- it RAISES rather than returning a bad curve.
      G3  PHYSICAL CONTINUITY.  Per-substring irradiance may change between
          consecutive steps by at most MAX_STEP_IRR_FRAC. Prevents a shadow
          "teleporting" -- an unphysical jump that would make relocation
          artificially easy or hard. Ties the data to the sun-driven rate.
      G4  PEAK-COUNT TIMELINE (diagnostic, not a gate).  n_peaks at each step is
          recorded and reported, so shape changes during a transition are visible
          rather than hidden inside an efficiency number. This is the "peaks on
          the curve" quantity.
      G5  UNIFORM CONTROL (run-level, in p12).  A no-relocation control sequence
          must score ~100% for every tracker, or the instrument is unsound.
      G6  REPRODUCIBILITY & SPLIT (run-level).  All randomness from
          config.seed_for; sequences drawn on VALIDATION modules only; held-out
          never touched here.

    This file owns G1-G4 and the data they guard. G5/G6 are the p12 runner's.

PROVENANCE
    Sun positions from pvlib.solarposition (astronomical, no network, no fit).
    Curves from the same device.module_iv / analyse used everywhere else, so a
    relocation curve is scored by the identical instrument as every static and
    EN 50530 figure.
